# **UVA Degree Plans**

> Google Sheets Templates for degree tracking at UVA

## About

This project was started after making a Sheets template to track graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in three years.

UVA's Student Information System (SIS) degree planner is overbearing and confusing. The Department of Computer Science did put out a [degree checklist](https://uvacsadvising.org/materials/uva-bscs-checklist.pdf) and [example schedule](https://uvacsadvising.org/materials/bscs-example-schedule.pdf) in pdf format. However, there exists value to creating a consolodated spreadsheet.

## How to use this project

- Make a copy of the degree plan
- Add previously taken courses
- Create a degree plan [^1]
